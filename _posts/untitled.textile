title:    Mental Rest
---

p. I've been thinking about mental rest a lot. I know I could benefit from letting my brain relax. My brain is running full speed all day. There's always a monitor running where I'm debugging something, reading something, researching something, so on and so on. When the work day is over, I grab my iPad and do the same thing. It's hard not to be engaged in something with my schedule. Day job, part-time night job, and finishing up a degree at a University make it difficult to do "nothing".

p. For the next week, I am going to set a side a block of time each day to relax. No studying, no programming/debugging, no research. Just relax. Probably just listen to some music. I expect to feel completely refreshed. I also think that all the information that I have been cramming into my brain will finally have a chance to sink in. If all goes well, I will post my thoughts.
