p. There is a reason I do not develop iOS application. Every time Apple decides they need their cut from a developers hard work, I am reminded why. Ironically, every time Apple decides to update their terms to make sure they have the upper hand, is about the time I am thinking I should start developing native mobile apps. I wake up quickly. I agree that Apple is entitled to their cut, but they are destroying what used to be a great platform for developers. A great developer friendly platform is what catapulted the iOS line of devices to begin with. There is no way the iPhone is where it is today without developers creating awesome apps for it. I'm not saying it wouldn't have been successful; just not _this_ successful.

p. I see Apple as having a "too big to fail" attitude. That is a razor's edge. Just ask Microsoft and they will tell you that no company is too big to fail.
