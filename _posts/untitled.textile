p. This starts my last week working from home. Next week I start working in an actual office. While that is a bit of a change for me, I am looking forward to working around other people. I love working from a home office, but I have always struggled with the solitude. I'm anxious to see how working around others affects my work flow and productivity.

p. I will be working for an outstanding young company doing Ruby development; mainly Rails. Another new paradigm for me will be full TDD. I think this will be the biggest learning curve. Not learning how to write and run tests, but how to approach TDD in a new setting. I haven't had the privilege of working where testing was a priority, although I have wanted to work in an agile setting for a long time. I feel this is the next logical step for me. 

p. The other point that I think may take some time are gems. I know I have a list of gems that I like to use and I assume other devs are the same way. I see a breaking-in period where I get familiar with their set of gems that they prefer. 

p. Hopefully, I will be able to bring as much to the table as I able to take away. It should be fun!
