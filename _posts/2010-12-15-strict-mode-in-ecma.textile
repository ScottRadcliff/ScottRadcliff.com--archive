p. "Strict Mode is Coming to Town":http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/

p. Douglas Crockford blogs about using strict mode in ES5. I am not sure how I feel about this yet. I can definitely see some advantages, but didn't we try this with XHTML already? Definitely a topic to research.
