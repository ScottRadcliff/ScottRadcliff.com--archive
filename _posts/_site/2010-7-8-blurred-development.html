<p>I have long thought that the line between developer and designer has become blurred. The instances where someone will only design a site are minimal. Today, designers are expected to be comfortable with the front-end; <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript, and developers should be comfortable with the elements of design; typography, proportion and scale, line, balance, etc.. If you are a developer and do not know any elements of design, Digital Web has a good primer from 2005 <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/elements_of_design/">http://www.digital-web.com/articles/elements_of_design/</a></p>
<p>I believe in this so much that I helped design a new two year college course that emphasizes web standards and teaches front-end development along side graphic design. It teaches jQuery, advanced <span class="caps">CSS</span> (meaning image sprites, CSS3, etc.), some HTML5, <span class="caps">MVC</span> concepts, and even version control. Those are all skills that a designer should have. This program is at Davis College and is listed <a href="http://daviscollege.edu/Program%20pdf/Website%20Design.pdf">here</a> [<span class="caps">PDF</span> file]</p>
<p>The point of my post is to share a link to the best darn podcasters on the net. Dan Benjamin and Jason Seifer do a few podcasts together, and I laugh every time I watch/listen to one of them, but the latest episode of the Dev Show showed me that they share my thoughts on blurred lines in web design. Itâ€™s a great show with lots of resources. Check it out.</p>
