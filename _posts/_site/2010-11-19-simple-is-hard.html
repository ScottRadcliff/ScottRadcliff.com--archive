<p>While sketching out and thinking through some code for a project, I am reminded again how hard it is make things simple. I have a natural tendency to over complicate code when I am developing. Call it over engineering, over thinking, thinking too much; whatever you tag it with, I seem to be plagued by it.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I try to do to make development simple.</p>
<p><strong>Break everything down to the smallest possible task</strong><br />
Take the largest of tasks and break them down to very small manageable tasks, and concentrate on those smaller tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Pseudo-code everything</strong><br />
I prefer to pseudo-code just about everything. This helps me in a few ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>It helps me catch logical errors before they end up in code and become harder to find.  </li>
	<li>It allows me to think about the methods that I may need to complete the task. I am usually working with some sort of <span class="caps">API</span> so this often helps me dig through the docs for the best solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worth noting that I don’t get crazy with the pseudo-code, just get the steps involved down on paper so I can see what is going on.</p>
<p><strong>Take a lot of short breaks</strong><br />
These little breaks bring me back to reality when I start to over-complicate the problem that is trying to be solved. These breaks often involve a “duh” moment.</p>
