<p>I recently decided to put Cucumber and some <span class="caps">BDD</span> to use on a real app. One problem. I drew a complete blank.  Not just &#8220;how do I write this test&#8221; kind of blank, but more like a &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m completely lost. I thought I knew how this stuff worked&#8221; kind of blank.</p>
<p>Thanks to the awesome screencast from <a href="http://peepcode.com">PeepCode</a>, I realized that I was going about it wrong. At least from a beginner point of view. I was writing say, 4-5 steps and then running the tests with no idea on how I should write the code to make it pass.</p>
<p>While watching the screencast I realized that I needed to break it down to one step. Just one very easy step at a time. Oh yeah, and there are already steps written in web_steps.rb. Use those.</p>
<p>My code went from:</p>
<p><code>Given I am a logged in user</code><br />
<code>When I am on the index page</code><br />
<code>I should see a list of items</code></p>
<p>Which would fail on the first step and have a few undefined steps.</p>
<p>To:</p>
<p><code>Given I am on the index page</code></p>
<p>Run that simple step. Make it pass, if doesn&#8217;t already, and then move on to the next step. I guess they are called steps for a reason after all.</p>
<p>My next step at this point might be:</p>
<p><code>I should see "My Super Cool App"</code></p>
<p>Now run that step. Make it pass and add another. Do that until I reach the end of that scenario.</p>
<p>This may seem silly to those that are fluent in <span class="caps">BDD</span>, but it really helped me wrap my head around the process of writing passing tests.</p>
