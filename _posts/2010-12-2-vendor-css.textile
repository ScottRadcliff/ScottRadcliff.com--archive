title:    Vendor Specific CSS
---


p. Teaching is a lot of fun, and often I end up being the one that is learning. This past Tuesday, while teaching the basics of CSS, a student had asked me about adding a drop shadow to the text on the project we were building. I thought this was a great opportunity to let them see how powerful CSS is and display how they should be cautious about vendor specific tags.

p. I got schooled, right there in front of the students. While trying to use -moz-text-shadow and watching it fail repeatedly, we discovered that text-shadow is now fully supported in Firefox. Firefox has dropped support for the vendor specific version. I assume Webkit has also.

p. The hidden gem in all of this? Learning through exploration and dialogue. While I was trying to debug my CSS code, students hit the Internet in an attempt to help. It was actually a student that found out that Firefox dropped support for the tag. That type of learning cannot be duplicated. Those students will remember how we solved that problem. There is not a book available that can teach that.

p. Lesson? _Always_ have a non vendor specific fall back.
