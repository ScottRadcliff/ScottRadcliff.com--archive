p. This was day two of using Vim as my editor. There are some features that are really growing on me, and some that I just don't like. I absolutely love the little keyboard shortcuts for things like copying an entire line "yy" or "Y", jumping to a line :[line number] (so typing :25 takes me to line 25) , and "p" for pasting from the clipboard. Those are real time savers and I can really see how these can save me time.

p. For the life of me, at least so far, I cannot map my brain to use "hjkl" for cursor movement. I end up spending quite a bit of time in insert mode. When I am in command mode, I have to force myself to use those keys, and even then I have to stop and think about what I am doing. After two days, I don't think I am much faster than I am in TextMate. I make pretty extensive use of TextMate snippets when in TextMate, so I ended up with a pretty fast workflow with that editor.

p. I am just not sure that the parts that I like will keep me in Vim. I may end up back in TextMate. That being said, I have been learned something everyday that makes me like Vim a little bit more.
