title:    Automating Tasks
---

p. I am experimenting with automating more tasks. I’m starting with my login for work. Every morning when I fire up my machine for work, I start a few programs. It’s not really a big deal, but I decided to venture into shell scripting to make this a command. My shell scripting skills currently suck.

p. The script is held in my code/helpers directory, so it needs to set the working directory to Applications so I can launch the apps I need. Once in the directory, I just launch the applications that I launch every morning.

@# Open apps for work@
@cd ~/../../Applications;@

@open "Google Chrome.app"@
@open Skype.app@
@open Mail.app@
@open TextMate.app@
