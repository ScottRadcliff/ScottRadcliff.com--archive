title:    A Smaller Bubble, but It's Still a Bubble

p. "No Tech Bubble":http://venturebeat.com/2011/02/17/graham-y-combinator-no-tech-bubble/

p. There's a post one Venture Beat about how the tech bubble that some believe we are in now is not like the bubble of the 90's. Paul Graham states that the players are different now than they were in the 90's. You could say it was the blind leading the blind when people saw the Internet as one  big dollar sign. I am not so sure that is still not the case. Sure, we have the Zuckerberg and Jason Fried types that understand technology and are steering their companies in a profitable position. They will be safe. The products that they run are _their_ products. Those products have been created and refined to serve a purpose. 

p. What about the products that get sold or take investments? TechCrunch, Heroku, and StackOverflow come to mind. What happens to them when there are investors behind the scenes with dollar signs in their eyes. Investors don't care about how well a product performs it's task, or how simple it is to use. They care about how much profit a product is turning. Remember, money is the root of all evil. We are in the midst of a bubble, only this time we have _some_ businesses that have learned from history.
