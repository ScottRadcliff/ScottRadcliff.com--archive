<a href="/Code/2010/10/04/i-suck-at-not-repeating-code.html" class="blog-heading">I Suck at Not Repeating Code</a>
<p>Every once in a while, a person has an eye-opening experience that causes them to rethink how they work, act, or react to certain situations. I have encountered such an experience. It would seem I am not as good at <span class="caps">DRY</span> principles as I would like to be. The good news is, I don&#8217;t think any of us are really where we would like to be when it comes to not repeating code. The bad news is, I thought I was a little better at it than I currently am. In defense of myself, the code in question is complex. There are multiple data sources all congregating in one place. Writing quick functions to perform tasks rather than really thinking about how to abstract the data is way too tempting, and I bit.</p>
<p>So now, after I beat myself up for a few hours for being stupid, I look at what I did wrong and make sure next time I am in a similar situation, I take the time to make sure I am optimizing the code instead of taking shortcuts and making more work for myself and fellow developers in the process.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, if you are a developer and have not read The Pragmatic Programmer, do it now. <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">Get the book</a></p>

<a href="/Code/2010/09/25/web-developer-professionalism.html" class="blog-heading">Web Developer Professionalism</a>
<p>I worked as an Ironworker for 14 years. In ironwork, the older men and women that are part of the workforce are the resource you want to be close to. They posses an incredible amount of wisdom. One statement that I was told by one of these old-timers has stuck with me over the years.</p>
<p>When starting out, like any occupation, I was slow and ineffective. I was reminded, “You will not get any faster, only more efficient”. I remembered that statement for those 14 years and it rang true time after time.</p>
<p>The same is true for web development. You can try to work as fast as you can, but the truth of the matter is; it does not matter how fast you type, you will only get faster through experience. The only result of typing blazing fast and cutting corners is bug infested, crappy code that you will be embarrassed to take claim to. This fact is being driven home with me day after day. No matter how hard I try, I can&#8217;t do my job any faster. Let me rephrase that. I can&#8217;t do my job any faster with a high level of quality and professionalism.</p>
<p>Our industry has an low barrier of entry. Anyone can “claim” to be a web developer. All they have to do to prove their skills is grab some cheap template, customize it, and clients have no clue that the &#8220;developer&#8221; doesn’t know what they are doing. It doesn&#8217;t even matter that the “developer” doesn&#8217;t understand the code, or to mention any security holes involved.</p>
<p>Professionalism is what separates us. If I plow through some code, slapping it together with a fragile codebase, I am not any different than the developer that grabs a template and calls it his own. A good developer takes into account security, speed, modularity, and pride. There really isn&#8217;t a way to rush those things. It just takes time, and I am finally realizing this. I would rather slow down and make a quality product, then rush through just to “ship it”.</p>

<a href="/Code/2010/09/06/those-crazy-designing-developers.html" class="blog-heading">Those Crazy Designing Developers</a>
<p>There is a great thought provoking post over at the <a href="http://thenerdary.net/">Nerdary</a> about the topic of developers and design. The post is a bit of a spin on the ol’ designers knowing code topic. If this were another boring post about designers and code, I would have passed it over, but the spin gathered my attention. Jenn Lukas has done a good job of putting it into context. It&#8217;s definitely worth a read. Here&#8217;s my two cents.</p>
<p>The path I took to web development involved an enlightenment of sorts. While I enjoyed designing and developing, I was clearly better at development. I understand programming logic, database structures, and performance more than I understand color theory. That is not saying that I don’t understand color theory, it’s saying that the programming concepts come more natural to me than the aesthetic theories. In the words of my favorite chef, Gordon Ramsay; “Employ somebody to do it for you. Play on your strengths, and improve your weaknesses.” That is the route I took. I play to my strengths while improving my weaknesses. I work hard at being the best developer that I possibly can while continually educating myself about design.</p>
<h2 class="default">Talking Design</h2>
<p>I’m not that bad. I am talking about design now. While in college for web design/development, I made a goal. My goal was to be the best developer there, while staying competent in design. I knew I would never be the best developer, but having something to measure yourself by is a great motivator. If the developer sitting next to me is killing me with his JavaScript skills; I want to know how. What does he know that I don’t? How can I be better? Answering these questions always make me better. It is worth mentioning that I never viewed these as competitions, but more as learning from each other. I have never looked down at someone that had less knowledge than me, and I would not refuse to teach anyone anything that I know. That is probably why I teach now.</p>
<p>So, the question is “Do developers need to know how to design?”. Yep, they do. Only if they want to be the best. If you are a developer and are content to make ugly software while relying on others to always make it look good, I wish you luck. Although, keep in mind that you will be left behind. You cannot develop an incredible user experience without aesthetics. It plays a huge role, and as a developer, you have to at least know what is good design. Hint. It is not all black with white text.</p>
<p>Design is as much about solving problems as programming is. In fact, every great designer I know might argue that design is problem solving. When a good designer is creating a web page, he is selecting shapes, color, spacing, and type with purpose. Hint. It’s not because they are pretty. It’s because that selection solves a problem.</p>
<h2 class="default">Designers code. Developers should design.</h2>
<p>Learn design, appreciate it, be a student, but be smart; when you need something incredible, get yourself an incredible designer.</p>
<p>A closing note, developers are only hired when a designer can’t make it happen with WordPress, jQuery, or another framework. Developers should act the same way regarding design. Don’t hire a designer if you can make a <span class="caps">CSS</span> framework work for you.</p>

<a href="/Stuff/2010/09/04/paid-holidays.html" class="blog-heading">Paid Holidays</a>
<p>Monday will be my first paid holiday in 14 years. I am enjoying be a web developer for someone else. Especially when I get paid to <em>not develop</em> anything.</p>

<a href="/Code/2010/08/28/chrome-fixes-too-many-errors.html" class="blog-heading">Chrome Fixes Too Man Errors</a>
<p>As a web developer, I need to see errors. Also, as a web developer, I need to be fast. These two requirements have caused me to jump from browser to browser like a madman. Firefox has the best debugging tools, but is too fat. Safari is super sleek, pretty fast, but I hate having to tab through tabs, or <em>gasp</em> reach for my mouse. I thought Chrome was getting there. It’s super fast, has some decent debugging tools, and seems to be gaining ground.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have an issue with Chrome that I am not sure I can get past. It auto-fixes too much. What I mean by that is that it takes my mistakes, which could be formatting errors, syntax errors, etc., and fixes them for me. Sounds great; except for one problem. Users that are using other browsers happen to see what I missed. Sure, I check in different browsers, but I don’t always have the time to check a browser for a simple change. If I screwed something up, I need to see that it is broken. Don’t fix it for me.</p>
<p>Okay, a few examples. Encoding issues seem to be auto-fixed in Chrome. I had some markup that wasn’t properly replaced with <span class="caps">HTML</span> entities and Chrome fixed them before displaying them. This is an awesome feature for an everyday user, not so great for a web developer. Another example: working on a page with a very large form that displays additional elements as needed. I had to make a quick change. Chrome showed the new change beautifully. Firefox/Safari showed the wreck that an error left behind.</p>
<p>Sorry Chrome, I would rather develop in a browser that allows me to see what is really happening. Maybe a “Developer mode” would allow a developer to see a page as it renders.</p>
