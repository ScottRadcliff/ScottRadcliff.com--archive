  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Wednesday, February 02, 2011</p>
    <p>I have this love/hate relationship with native mobile apps. They definitely have their place, but are often overused; I&#8217;m a huge  proponent of the mobile web. I think as developers, we should build apps not for a platform, but for a purpose. More often than not, this involves more than one platform. Games are exempt in my opinion. Native code is a perfect fit for games.</p>
<p>37signals just released a <a href="http://basecamphq.com/mobile">mobile version of Basecamp</a>. It&#8217;s a great app, and done purely in web technologies. This is a giant leap forward for a few reasons. One: some devs that are on the fence about mobile might look at this app and realize that it&#8217;s okay to go web versus native. Two: the crew at 37signals are creating quite a stir about their Cinco framework, which appears to be a rapid application framework for web apps, and will be open sourced</p>
<p>I&#8217;m anxiously waiting for the release of Cinco. I have been looking for a mobile web solution and was entertaining the idea of creating my own micro framework. Maybe something based on Sinatra, but I would rather contribute to something that has the talent that 37signals brings behind it.</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Tuesday, February 01, 2011</p>
    <p>I’ve griped about jQuery plenty. Not the framework itself, it’s an awesome tool to have when doing front end work, but the code that many produce with jQuery. I like to call it <em>anonymous functionitis</em>. New developers see anonymous functions in jQuery code, assume <em>everything</em> should be done that way, and create code that doesn’t promote reuse. The code is full of functions that serve one purpose and need to be recreated if they are needed elsewhere. Another thing that bugs me is throwing everything in <span class="caps">DOM</span> ready. I mark this up as inexperience.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/">Rebecca Murphy</a> has done a nice job of summing this up in her JS Conf talk <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/the_jquery_divide_by_rebecca_m.html">The jQuery Divide</a>. I think she is right; we need to educate those that write poor jQuery. But how?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Teach the need to understand what jQuery is doing. New developers should dig into the code and learn how jQuery does what it does.</li>
	<li>Promote writing JavaScript without jQuery.</li>
	<li>Take a part of JavaScript (event handlers, animations, Ajax) and really explain how it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those of us that understand the language, help teach those that do not, maybe we can  move the developer community forward.  With event driven JavaScript gaining speed, there hasn’t been a better time to promote the core language.</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Monday, January 31, 2011</p>
    <p>Listening to the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/podcasts">Pragmatic Podcast</a> recently, I picked up on the term <em>Project Portfolio</em> and it got me thinking. What if, instead of trying to show what I have worked on for client work; which is usually behind an <span class="caps">NDA</span> or some other form of agreement that prevents me from showing or claiming anything, I would just publish everything that I build locally. All the little todo apps, note taking apps, etc. All of them published on the web.</p>
<p>I never really liked the idea of a portfolio. What a time consuming pain. I mean I see the need for a professional portfolio; accolades, awards, letters of recommendation, etc. But a web portfolio is a time sucker and a blind display of work. I have no idea if the urls are active anymore. I guess I could host a local copy of the site in some circumstances, but then it may not match the actual site. What if the client changes script/images/etc.. Then I really don’t have any control. What a pain. I have never been a fan of them.</p>
<p>My personal projects on the other hand, are a labor of love. These are the apps I use almost daily. I continually improve and tweak them. If I really think about it, this is where my best work is at. This is where I experiment, try new technologies, optimize for speed,  so on and so on. I’m really thinking about starting a projects section and throwing up all my projects on there. Publishing more was a goal this year, sounds like a good way to get started.</p>

    <p>This may be something new, but I stumbled onto something today. Apparently you can search some websites in Chrome directly from the address bar.</p>
<p><img src="/images/search_chrome.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you add a space after the <span class="caps">URL</span>, you can then search the site for what you need. Completely awesome for finding Gems on GitHub.</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Tuesday, January 18, 2011</p>
    <p>As long as I can remember w3schools have been around and honestly I had no idea that it was not part of the official W3C. Recently a movement has been started to bring awareness that the information at w3schools is inaccurate and that the wrong information is worse than no information. While I do agree that information should be accurate, I wonder where new designers and developers to web design will get their information. Surely we can’t expect them to go through the actual documentation. Even seasoned pros find that painful to sift through.</p>
<p>W3schools helped me quite a bit starting out. I don’t think the name was as much of a factor as the content. Even the fact that some of the content was inaccurate didn’t hurt me when I was starting out. It helped me get started quickly; as I learned more I expanded my resources.</p>
<h2>Where should a person go to learn the syntax for making web sites?</h2>
<p>I have spent some time searching for a suitable replacement. There isn’t one. Okay, let me rephrase that; there isn’t a <strong><em>good</em></strong> one. There are plenty of resources available, but they are fragmented at best. If someone that has experience is looking for documentation and knows what they are looking for, these resources work. But what about the person that doesn’t know what they are looking for? That person only knows that they want to do it the <em>right way</em>; the web standards way. Where do they go?</p>
<h2>It’s time to build a better system</h2>
<p><a href="http://w3fools.com/">http://w3fools.com/</a> makes mention of the community building a better system, but then shies away from the idea as if it is not possible. I believe it’s wrong to shy away from it. If we as a community are going to call an organization out because they have inaccurate information, we <strong>have</strong> to build something better.</p>
<h2>Initial ideas</h2>
<p>Here is what I think the new system has to have</p>
<ul>
	<li>A way to see immediate results with the code you are looking for. This is the one thing that I loved about w3schools; I could get immediate feedback with what happens when I do [x]. Those little text editors are a great learning tool.</li>
	<li>Up to date documents that are completely searchable. I think <a href="http://apidock.com/">http://apidock.com/</a> does this well. As does <a href="http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/">http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/</a>. Something like that would be great, but with full text search.</li>
	<li>Newbie friendly.</li>
	<li>Editable. Similar to a wiki. I think this helps avoid the outdated problem, but raises another one in sources. Sources would have to be displayed for it to be credible.</li>
</ul>
<p>That would be a good start. I certainly couldn’t do it myself, but would be willing to jump in and help. I just can’t see complaining about something without action.</p>
<p>If someone has already started something, I would love to hear about it and participate.</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Wednesday, January 05, 2011</p>
    <p>I am experimenting with automating more tasks. I’m starting with my login for work. Every morning when I fire up my machine for work, I start a few programs. It’s not really a big deal, but I decided to venture into shell scripting to make this a command. My shell scripting skills currently suck.</p>
<p>The script is held in my code/helpers directory, so it needs to set the working directory to Applications so I can launch the apps I need. Once in the directory, I just launch the applications that I launch every morning.</p>
<p><code># Open apps for work</code><br />
<code>cd ~/../../Applications;</code></p>
<p><code>open "Google Chrome.app"</code><br />
<code>open Skype.app</code><br />
<code>open Mail.app</code><br />
<code>open TextMate.app</code></p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Wednesday, December 29, 2010</p>
    <p>As the end of the year approaches, like most people, I start to reflect on the year that is set to expire. This year was an interesting one. I have the first full year of teaching under my belt, I starting working for a company as a developer, and I have evolved as a developer more than in any other year.</p>
<h2>Where Am I now?</h2>
<p>As I write this, I happen to be on a bit of a break. Usually, I am working either 7-4 or 8-5 and I teach from 5:40 until 9:30 &#8211; 10ish twice a week. Besides that, I am finishing my degree at <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/"><span class="caps">BGSU</span></a>. Needless to say, I have a very full plate, but it’s all fun. Okay, the finishing the degree part kind of sucks, but that is more likely due to the content of the courses than the actual work.</p>
<p>I have really grown in all aspects of work. Well, it’s not really work most of the time; I really do enjoy it. Teaching is a great way for me to give back to the community. I love helping prepare web designers with tools and skills that they will actually use. I think I have improved in my teaching style, but ultimately the students would have to answer that. I know I have benefitted from my education at BG to improve the environment that I create for learning.</p>
<h3>Developer Status</h3>
<p>As for being a developer, I have learned a lot from working with other developers. I still find it amazing how much I can learn from just being around other developers. It’s something every developer should do. Not only through work, but through play also. Hanging out with like-minded developers is incredibly inspiring.</p>
<p>I still struggle with developer speed. I hate doing things that are “good enough”. Because of that, I spend a lot of time tweaking and refactoring when I probably should learn to just close the file and move on. This is probably the one area I need to work on. More on that later.</p>
<h3>Frameworks</h3>
<p>Frameworks were a big part of my 2010. Up until this year, I started every project from scratch; that included <span class="caps">PHP</span>, JavaScript, and <span class="caps">CSS</span>. <span class="caps">PHP</span> frameworks came first; mainly <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>, then came the JavaScript frameworks, finally settling on <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Recently, I have been using <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">BlueprintCSS</a> for common <span class="caps">CSS</span> layouts. I started to feel that it was insane to replicate the same layouts over and over. Blueprint fits my workflow well and hopefully makes me a little faster.</p>
<p>This year also brought on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, and it blew me away. I slowly started moving away from <span class="caps">PHP</span>. My day job still requires <span class="caps">PHP</span>, but for anything I start outside of work; Rails it is. Rails has really helped me grow as a developer. I started looking at my code with a test first mentality. The conventions in Rails almost force me to do things in a certain way. I have become accustomed to the &#8220;Rails Way&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Where Would I Like to be?</h2>
<p>There are a few goals that I have for the coming year. Naturally, I want improve in all aspects of developing and teaching. As I mentioned earlier, speed is my largest defect.  What I have yet to figure out is whether I am taking too long because I am adding quality code, or if the time if takes me is necessary to produce quality code. This will be a large turning point for me this year. I plan on concentrating on speed a lot, I still believe that web development is a creative craft that requires knowledge, experience, creativity, and pride. I try to treat every line of code as if it were my personal project. I definitely would not cut corners on something I am building for myself. I do not want to sacrifice that quality for speed, but fear that I have to make a compromise.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of half finished side projects laying around. I am going to make this the year I just release projects. They could be anything. I am no longer concerned with if what I am building has been done or not. Often, what I am building does exist, but does not fit what I want it to do enough.</p>
<p>Developers are encouraged to learn one new language a year. I do agree with this, it&#8217;s a great way to stay on top of your craft. I am approaching 2011 a little differently. I am really concentrating on <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. I mean really mastering it. All of the ins and outs of the language.</p>
<p>Sadly, my JavaScript skills have slid in the last few years. I&#8217;m not saying I don&#8217;t know JavaScript well, but the JavaScript development of the past few years has <em>really</em> moved the language forward and I feel that I am not as good as I could or should be.</p>
<h3>How Do I Get There?</h3>
<p>In order to be where I would like to be by the end of 2011, there are a few things that I must do. The first thing is to make time for side projects and personal and professional development. It’s a lot easier said than done while working a full-time, part-time job, and still taking some online classes. I have a few ideas; start work a half an hour early, have a working lunch, work on the projects after work, or just simply limiting all of these social networks I am involved with. If I am going to release projects, code, and such; I need to work on those projects and shut Twitter down.</p>
<p>Releasing projects that are not perfect is a pain point for anyone in a creative profession. This is item number two. I’m still scared this is going to burn me, but I am going to do it anyway. Burns heal, right?</p>
<p>I think the best way to advance with a language is to do something meaningful. Hello World and a blog (<em>the new hello world</em>) only go so far. To really use a technology or language, you need to have useful case for it. Maybe it gets released, maybe it doesn’t. One thing for sure, you learn a lot about how to really use the language. I love the Code Kata ideas, so I plan on rolling my own; creating some katas that are more relevant to me as far as something I might actually use. With any luck, I might stumble onto something. Worst case scenario, I accomplish my goal of really digging into Ruby and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Here is to a great 2011!</p>
