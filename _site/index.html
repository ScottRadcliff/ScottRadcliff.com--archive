  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Tuesday, May 31, 2011</p>
    <p>Leave code better than you found it. I heard <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unclebobmartin">Uncle Bob</a> say that. I can&#8217;t recall if it was a video, blog post, or interview; but it hit me right between the eyes. When I heard &#8220;leave code better than you found it&#8221;, I was actively developing around code. I saw code that could be better, but left it. I saw code that I didn&#8217;t understand. Instead of  understanding it and using my code to extend it, I coded around that also.</p>
<p>What really sucks is that I never used to be that way. I <em>became</em> that way. Tight deadlines, working with code I didn&#8217;t write, and inexperience made me that way. Inexperience? No, not inexperience as a developer; inexperience working with others. Working with other developers is intimidating. I wonder if I am good enough, fast enough, or even smart enough. It&#8217;s easy to try to work faster than I am capable of. The end result is never pleasant. As developers, we don&#8217;t get faster by working faster. We get faster by becoming more efficient. No amount of corner cutting will change that. It took one sentence for me to be reminded of that.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much to leave code better. Reduce database calls or <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, add some caching, optimize a block or loop, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"><span class="caps">DRY</span></a> something up. You don&#8217;t have to refactor the entire application. Just refactor one method. Speaking of methods, this applies to more than server side code. Front end code needs this too. Simplify an <span class="caps">HTML</span> element, remove <a href="http://www.apaddedcell.com/div-itis-what-it-and-how-avoid-it">divitis</a>, or reduce <span class="caps">CSS</span> duplication. Again, it doesn&#8217;t take much. Just think if you did this every time you opened a file. Software would continually get better and would be generally more pleasant to use.</p>

  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Friday, February 18, 2011</p>
    <p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/02/17/graham-y-combinator-no-tech-bubble/">No Tech Bubble</a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a post one Venture Beat about how the tech bubble that some believe we are in now is not like the bubble of the 90&#8217;s. Paul Graham states that the players are different now than they were in the 90&#8217;s. You could say it was the blind leading the blind when people saw the Internet as one  big dollar sign. I am not so sure that is still not the case. Sure, we have the Zuckerberg and Jason Fried types that understand technology and are steering their companies in a profitable position. They will be safe. The products that they run are <em>their</em> products. Those products have been created and refined to serve a purpose.</p>
<p>What about the products that get sold or take investments? TechCrunch, Heroku, and StackOverflow come to mind. What happens to them when there are investors behind the scenes with dollar signs in their eyes. Investors don&#8217;t care about how well a product performs it&#8217;s task, or how simple it is to use. They care about how much profit a product is turning. Remember, money is the root of all evil. We are in the midst of a bubble, only this time we have <em>some</em> businesses that have learned from history.</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Thursday, February 17, 2011</p>
    <p>Commenting code when I know I will not be returning to it has got me thinking. Firstly, as I finish out this week at my current job and know that someone else will be editing this code in the future; actually, they will probably be finishing the code. I have been writing some really detailed comments. Some of them may be too detailed, but that&#8217;s okay. I would rather the next developer look at a comment and think that it was unnecessary, rather than wondering what that code does and spending time decyphering each line to get a grasp on the purpose. I haven&#8217;t went as far as</p>
<pre><code>$i=0 // Set variable i to 0</code></pre>
<p>That would be really stupid. But I have written:</p>
<pre><code>// Create an array to store values for different education classes
$classes = array();</code></pre>
<p>I know classes is pretty self explanatory, and I could have named the variable education_classes, but just one comment that takes up no more than one line makes it perfectly clear that this does. Here is another example:</p>
<pre><code>// filter through options extracting the value
// and applying it to the classes array
foreach($query-&gt;result() as $item) {
  $classes[] = $item;
}</code></pre>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory, but when someone hits this code for a quick change or is looking for a possible bug it should help them scan the file looking for the section they need. Of course I have PHP_doc comments for methods and classes. As I look over the code I have written this week I question my comment writing on projects that I know I will return to. I usually do not comment like this and it has burned me in terms of time. Reading each line of code to determine where the culprit of a bug may be is much more time consuming than just scanning the comments.</p>
<p>I say apply too many comments rather than too few. If the other developers that you work with do not like them, they can choose to not read them. My guess is even if the comments seem excessive, they will be useful in that one instance that may save you at 5:00 on a Friday.</p>
<p><em>Worth noting that this style of commenting has to be kept up to date. Read your comments often, and edit when necessary.</em></p>

  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Wednesday, February 16, 2011</p>
    <p>There is a reason I do not develop iOS applications. Every time Apple decides they need their cut from a developers hard work, I am reminded why. Ironically, every time Apple decides to update their terms to make sure they have the upper hand, is about the time I start thinking I should start developing native mobile apps. I wake up quickly. I agree that Apple is entitled to their cut, but they are destroying what used to be a great platform for developers. A great developer friendly platform is what catapulted the iOS line of devices to begin with. There is no way the iPhone is where it is today without developers creating awesome apps for it. I&#8217;m not saying it wouldn&#8217;t have been successful; just not <em>this</em> successful.</p>
<p>I see Apple as having a &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; attitude. That is a razor&#8217;s edge. Just ask Microsoft and they will tell you that no company is too big to fail. Back when I switched to Apple products, it was because they offered what I wanted. I wanted to do Rails development, and I liked what I saw in terms of tools. TextMate, for example. Sure, I could do Rails development on a Windows machine, but it sucks. Trust me. I set up a Rails environment on a Windows box. Torture! So I jumped ship.</p>
<p>I fear a similar situation with what Apple is doing now. It won&#8217;t be anytime soon, but if they keep screwing around with their iOS developers, they will leave. They will take the path of least resistance, just like I did when I came to Apple.  And when Android has that one exclusive app, <em>think Angry Birds when it was iOS only</em>, the ball will start rolling. It all starts with one awesome app that you can&#8217;t get anywhere else.</p>
<p>(2-18-11) <em>Update</em>: Google may have smelled blood. They just released <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/onepass/">One Pass</a>, a possible competitor to Apple&#8217;s subscription plan.</p>

    <p>I sat with my family and watched Watson, <em>the computer <span class="caps">IBM</span> created</em>, compete on Jeopardy and we were in awe of the awesome. This really was historic, not to mention a genius move by <span class="caps">IBM</span>. Why was it genius by <span class="caps">IBM</span>?</p>
<ol>
	<li>The country saw <span class="caps">IBM</span> exercise their motto &#8220;Build a smarter planet&#8221;. Even though through the first round Watson stumbled a bit, it was impressive how this machine could parse and answer human language.</li>
	<li>Non-technical people had the opportunity to see the people that were behind the machine. This is something that normal people often do not see. Most people just expect computers to work, never giving a thought to who built it, or how much time went into it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those two points can stand on their own, but I think the most impressive thing about Watson is what it leads to after Jeopardy. Possibilities in various fields were mentioned, including the medical field. That is the most impressive part. What technology will be spawned from a game?</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Thursday, February 10, 2011</p>
    <p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about mental rest a lot. I know I could benefit from letting my brain relax. My brain is running full speed all day. There&#8217;s always a monitor running where I&#8217;m debugging something, reading something, researching something, so on and so on. When the work day is over, I grab my iPad and do the same thing. It&#8217;s hard not to be engaged in something with my schedule. Day job, part-time night job, and finishing up a degree at a University make it difficult to do &#8220;nothing&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the next week, I am going to set a side a block of time each day to relax. No studying, no programming/debugging, no research; just relax. Probably just listen to some music. I expect to feel completely refreshed. I also think that all the information that I have been cramming into my brain will finally have a chance to sink in. If all goes well, I will post my thoughts.</p>

    <p>I have this love/hate relationship with native mobile apps. They definitely have their place, but are often overused; I&#8217;m a huge  proponent of the mobile web. I think as developers, we should build apps not for a platform, but for a purpose. More often than not, this involves more than one platform. Games are exempt in my opinion. Native code is a perfect fit for games.</p>
<p>37signals just released a <a href="http://basecamphq.com/mobile">mobile version of Basecamp</a>. It&#8217;s a great app, and done purely in web technologies. This is a giant leap forward for a few reasons. One: some devs that are on the fence about mobile might look at this app and realize that it&#8217;s okay to go web versus native. Two: the crew at 37signals are creating quite a stir about their Cinco framework, which appears to be a rapid application framework for web apps, and will be open sourced</p>
<p>I&#8217;m anxiously waiting for the release of Cinco. I have been looking for a mobile web solution and was entertaining the idea of creating my own micro framework. Maybe something based on Sinatra, but I would rather contribute to something that has the talent that 37signals brings behind it.</p>

    <p>I’ve griped about jQuery plenty. Not the framework itself, it’s an awesome tool to have when doing front end work, but the code that many produce with jQuery. I like to call it <em>anonymous functionitis</em>. New developers see anonymous functions in jQuery code, assume <em>everything</em> should be done that way, and create code that doesn’t promote reuse. The code is full of functions that serve one purpose and need to be recreated if they are needed elsewhere. Another thing that bugs me is throwing everything in <span class="caps">DOM</span> ready. I mark this up as inexperience.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/">Rebecca Murphy</a> has done a nice job of summing this up in her JS Conf talk <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/the_jquery_divide_by_rebecca_m.html">The jQuery Divide</a>. I think she is right; we need to educate those that write poor jQuery. But how?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Teach the need to understand what jQuery is doing. New developers should dig into the code and learn how jQuery does what it does.</li>
	<li>Promote writing JavaScript without jQuery.</li>
	<li>Take a part of JavaScript (event handlers, animations, Ajax) and really explain how it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those of us that understand the language, help teach those that do not, maybe we can  move the developer community forward.  With event driven JavaScript gaining speed, there hasn’t been a better time to promote the core language.</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-date">Posted on: Monday, January 31, 2011</p>
    <p>Listening to the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/podcasts">Pragmatic Podcast</a> recently, I picked up on the term <em>Project Portfolio</em> and it got me thinking. What if, instead of trying to show what I have worked on for client work; which is usually behind an <span class="caps">NDA</span> or some other form of agreement that prevents me from showing or claiming anything, I would just publish everything that I build locally. All the little todo apps, note taking apps, etc. All of them published on the web.</p>
<p>I never really liked the idea of a portfolio. What a time consuming pain. I mean I see the need for a professional portfolio; accolades, awards, letters of recommendation, etc. But a web portfolio is a time sucker and a blind display of work. I have no idea if the urls are active anymore. I guess I could host a local copy of the site in some circumstances, but then it may not match the actual site. What if the client changes script/images/etc.. Then I really don’t have any control. What a pain. I have never been a fan of them.</p>
<p>My personal projects on the other hand, are a labor of love. These are the apps I use almost daily. I continually improve and tweak them. If I really think about it, this is where my best work is at. This is where I experiment, try new technologies, optimize for speed,  so on and so on. I’m really thinking about starting a projects section and throwing up all my projects on there. Publishing more was a goal this year, sounds like a good way to get started.</p>

    <p>This may be something new, but I stumbled onto something today. Apparently you can search some websites in Chrome directly from the address bar.</p>
<p><img src="/images/search_chrome.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you add a space after the <span class="caps">URL</span>, you can then search the site for what you need. Completely awesome for finding Gems on GitHub.</p>
