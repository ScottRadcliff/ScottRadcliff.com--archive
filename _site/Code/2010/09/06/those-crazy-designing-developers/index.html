    <p class="post-date">Posted on: Monday, September 06, 2010</p>
      <p>There is a great thought provoking post over at the <a href="http://thenerdary.net/">Nerdary</a> about the topic of developers and design. The post is a bit of a spin on the ol’ designers knowing code topic. If this were another boring post about designers and code, I would have passed it over, but the spin gathered my attention. Jenn Lukas has done a good job of putting it into context. It&#8217;s definitely worth a read. Here&#8217;s my two cents.</p>
<p>The path I took to web development involved an enlightenment of sorts. While I enjoyed designing and developing, I was clearly better at development. I understand programming logic, database structures, and performance more than I understand color theory. That is not saying that I don’t understand color theory, it’s saying that the programming concepts come more natural to me than the aesthetic theories. In the words of my favorite chef, Gordon Ramsay; “Employ somebody to do it for you. Play on your strengths, and improve your weaknesses.” That is the route I took. I play to my strengths while improving my weaknesses. I work hard at being the best developer that I possibly can while continually educating myself about design.</p>
<h2 class="default">Talking Design</h2>
<p>I’m not that bad. I am talking about design now. While in college for web design/development, I made a goal. My goal was to be the best developer there, while staying competent in design. I knew I would never be the best developer, but having something to measure yourself by is a great motivator. If the developer sitting next to me is killing me with his JavaScript skills; I want to know how. What does he know that I don’t? How can I be better? Answering these questions always make me better. It is worth mentioning that I never viewed these as competitions, but more as learning from each other. I have never looked down at someone that had less knowledge than me, and I would not refuse to teach anyone anything that I know. That is probably why I teach now.</p>
<p>So, the question is “Do developers need to know how to design?”. Yep, they do. Only if they want to be the best. If you are a developer and are content to make ugly software while relying on others to always make it look good, I wish you luck. Although, keep in mind that you will be left behind. You cannot develop an incredible user experience without aesthetics. It plays a huge role, and as a developer, you have to at least know what is good design. Hint. It is not all black with white text.</p>
<p>Design is as much about solving problems as programming is. In fact, every great designer I know might argue that design is problem solving. When a good designer is creating a web page, he is selecting shapes, color, spacing, and type with purpose. Hint. It’s not because they are pretty. It’s because that selection solves a problem.</p>
<h2 class="default">Designers code. Developers should design.</h2>
<p>Learn design, appreciate it, be a student, but be smart; when you need something incredible, get yourself an incredible designer.</p>
<p>A closing note, developers are only hired when a designer can’t make it happen with WordPress, jQuery, or another framework. Developers should act the same way regarding design. Don’t hire a designer if you can make a <span class="caps">CSS</span> framework work for you.</p>
