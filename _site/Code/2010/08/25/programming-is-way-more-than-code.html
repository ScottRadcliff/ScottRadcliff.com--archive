<h1>Programming is Way More Than Code</h1>
<p>I finally got around to grabbing a copy of The Mythical Man-Month. Sure, I’ve known about for the book a long time, but I didn’t actually start out in software development so it wasn’t very high on my reading list. Programming beyond the client-side has always intrigued me; it has only been recently that I have really started studying software development.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what The Mythical-Man Month is about, it is a series of software essays that have stood the test of time. That is one of the issues that has kept me from reading the book. It is not current at all, but as I am reading it, I find myself directly associating the concepts with projects that I am working on now.</p>
<p>One point in particular has really jumped out at me. The book discusses that the act of coding is only 10% of programming. Sure, I have always known this fact; I still struggle with it. I get under the gun, projects get demanding, I misunderstand the requirements, and I immediately associate productivity with my fingers punching out code as fast as they possiblly can. The result is always the same. I get half way through it and start removing code, noticing there is a better way to do a certain task, or get frustrated with code bloat.<br />
p. I have been reminded that 90% of programming is thinking. I am much more productive when I open Pages, lay out the objectives, write pseudo-code, review, and then write the actual code. Not only am I more productive, but the code is leaner, faster, and smarter. I have a chance to catch bugs or errors before it is in the code, and I have the opportunity to re-think the logic.</p>
