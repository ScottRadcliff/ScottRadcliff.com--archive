  <p>I worked as an Ironworker for 14 years. In ironwork, the older men and women that are part of the workforce are the resource you want to be close to. They posses an incredible amount of wisdom. One statement that I was told by one of these old-timers has stuck with me over the years.</p>
<p>When starting out, like any occupation, I was slow and ineffective. I was reminded, “You will not get any faster, only more efficient”. I remembered that statement for those 14 years and it rang true time after time.</p>
<p>The same is true for web development. You can try to work as fast as you can, but the truth of the matter is; it does not matter how fast you type, you will only get faster through experience. The only result of typing blazing fast and cutting corners is bug infested, crappy code that you will be embarrassed to take claim to. This fact is being driven home with me day after day. No matter how hard I try, I can&#8217;t do my job any faster. Let me rephrase that. I can&#8217;t do my job any faster with a high level of quality and professionalism.</p>
<p>Our industry has an low barrier of entry. Anyone can “claim” to be a web developer. All they have to do to prove their skills is grab some cheap template, customize it, and clients have no clue that the &#8220;developer&#8221; doesn’t know what they are doing. It doesn&#8217;t even matter that the “developer” doesn&#8217;t understand the code, or to mention any security holes involved.</p>
<p>Professionalism is what separates us. If I plow through some code, slapping it together with a fragile codebase, I am not any different than the developer that grabs a template and calls it his own. A good developer takes into account security, speed, modularity, and pride. There really isn&#8217;t a way to rush those things. It just takes time, and I am finally realizing this. I would rather slow down and make a quality product, then rush through just to “ship it”.</p>
